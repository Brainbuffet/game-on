Game On will allow you to create everything from a complex gaming/learning environment to a functioning online economy with your WordPress site. 

== Description ==

Game On brings an exciting edge to your WordPress site that you control & create. Supports Task Assignments (content type), currency/points/time/ranking systems, store items (content type). Live notifications for your users whenever they gain time, currency, points, or level up! 

Tasks - Tasks can require a specific rank at which they can be started. They have 4 stages - encountered, accepted, completed, and mastered. You can also make some quests repeatable, and you can set the amount of currency and points someone gains for each stage of the task. Finally, you can write a mastery message to be displayed for users that master the task.
